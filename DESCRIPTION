Description: Provides a wrapper for several 'FFTW' functions. This package provides access to the two-dimensional 'FFT', the multivariate 'FFT', and the one-dimensional real to complex 'FFT' using the 'FFTW3' library. The package includes the functions fftw() and mvfftw() which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions fft() and mvfft(). The 'FFT' functions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant complex conjugate when the input is real data.
